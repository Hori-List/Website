# Hori Website
Work in progress.
This website will (1) act as a product page showcasing the app and its features and (2) be used to redirect users who already have the app installed, but clicked for example on a verification link, to the app.
Currently, it only does 2.
Although 1 is important the app is not far enough into development that it would make sense to spend development time on this rather than the app.
